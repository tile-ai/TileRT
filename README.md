<a id="overview"></a>

**TileRT** is a project designed to serve large language models (LLMs) in ultra-low-latency scenarios. Its goal is to push the latency limits of LLMs without compromising model size or quality—enabling models with hundreds of billions of parameters to achieve millisecond-level time per output token (TPOT).

Unlike traditional inference systems optimized for high-throughput batch processing, TileRT prioritizes **responsiveness**, which is critical for applications such as high-frequency trading, interactive AI, real-time decision-making, long-running agents, and AI-assisted coding, where the latency of individual requests matters most.

To achieve this, TileRT introduces a **tile-level runtime engine**. Leveraging a compiler-driven approach, LLM operators are decomposed into fine-grained tile-level tasks, while the runtime dynamically reschedules computation, I/O, and communication across multiple devices in a highly overlapped manner. This design minimizes idle time and improves hardware utilization.

The project is actively evolving, and the underlying compiler techniques will be gradually shared with the community as they are integrated into **TileLang** and **TileScale**.

## Installation

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Python Package Installation](#python-package-installation)

### Prerequisites

Before installing TileRT, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

**Hardware Requirements**

- 8× NVIDIA B200 GPUs

**Operating System**

- Linux x86_64 (Ubuntu 20.04 or later recommended)

**Python Version**

- Python 3.11 – 3.12
  *(The wheel package is built and tested against these versions.)*

**PyTorch Build**

- PyTorch wheels compiled for CUDA 12.8 or 12.9
  *(Must match the CUDA driver/runtime version required for B200 GPUs.)*

### Python Package Installation

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> **Disclaimer**: TileRT is an experimental project. The current pre-built package supports the 8-GPU B200 setup. For the most reliable experience, we strongly recommend installing the package within the provided Docker image.

The recommended installation method is using the pre-configured Docker image, which includes all necessary dependencies.

**Step 1: Pull the Docker image**

```bash
docker pull tileai/tilert:v0.1.0
```

**Step 2: Launch a Docker container**

```bash
IMAGE_NAME="tileai/tilert:v0.1.0"
WORKSPACE_PATH="/path/to/your/workspace"  # Replace with your actual workspace path

docker run --gpus all -it \
    -v $WORKSPACE_PATH:/workspace/ \
    $IMAGE_NAME
```

**Step 3: Install the TileRT package**

Once inside the container, install TileRT using pip:

```bash
pip install tilert
```

You're now ready to use TileRT! Proceed to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to download model weights and run your first inference.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Official Model Weights

Starting from release v0.1.3, TileRT no longer requires downloading pre-converted weights from Hugging Face. Instead, you can download the official model weights directly from the model's source (e.g., Hugging Face), and then convert them using the weight converter script included with the latest TileRT release.

### Step 2: Convert Weights Using `weight_converter.py`

After downloading the official model weights, you can use the following command to convert them into a format compatible with TileRT:

For **DeepSeek-V3.2**, run:

```bash
python -m tilert.models.preprocess.weight_converter \
  --model_type deepseek-v32 \
  --model_dir "/path/to/DeepSeek-V3.2" \
  --save_dir "/path/to/DeepSeek-V3.2-TileRT"
```

Replace `/path/to/DeepSeek-V3.2` with the directory where you've downloaded the model weights, and `/path/to/DeepSeek-V3.2-TileRT` with the directory where you'd like the converted weights to be saved.

Similarly, for **GLM-5**, run:

```bash
python -m tilert.models.preprocess.weight_converter \
  --model_type glm-5 \
  --model_dir "/path/to/GLM-5-FP8" \
  --save_dir "/path/to/GLM-5-FP8-TileRT"
```

Replace `/path/to/GLM-5-FP8` with the directory containing the downloaded GLM-5 model weights, and `/path/to/GLM-5-FP8-TileRT` with the desired location for saving the converted weights.

### Step 3: Set the Converted Weights Directory

Once the weights are converted, set the environment variable to point TileRT to the directory containing the converted weights:

```bash
export MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR= ... # converted weights
```

Now you're ready to use TileRT with the converted weights!

### Running the Generation Example

After downloading the model weights, you can run the generation example within the Docker environment as follows:

```bash
MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR="/path/to/tilert_weights"

docker run --gpus all -it \
    -v $WORKSPACE_PATH:/workspace/ \
    -v $MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR:$MODEL_WEIGHTS_MOUNT \
    tilert:v0.1.0
```

Once inside the container, run the following Python script to perform text generation:

```python
from tilert.models.deepseek_v3_2.dsa_show_hands import ShowHandsGenerator

generator: ShowHandsGenerator = ShowHandsGenerator(
    max_new_tokens=1000,
    model_weights_dir=MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR,
    with_mtp=False,  # Disable MTP
)
generator.from_pretrained()

prompt = (
    "Tell me three jokes:\n\n"
    "1. A dad joke,\n"
    "2. A programmer joke,\n"
    "3. A joke that only makes sense if you've ever tried "
    "to train a large language model.\n"
    "Keep each joke under 15 words."
)

print("Prompt:", prompt)
print("Completion:")
completion = generator.generate(prompt)
```

For example, TileRT may generate:

<details>
<summary><b>Sample output (click to expand)</b></summary>

```text
1. I'm afraid for the calendar. Its days are numbered.
2. There are only 10 kinds of people: those who understand binary and those who don't.
3. My model's loss is low, but its answers are still nonsense. Overfitting.
```

</details>

This example demonstrates basic single-step autoregressive generation using the precompiled model.

### Running the Generation Example with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)

TileRT also supports Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), which allows the model to generate multiple tokens per forward pass and reduces sequential decoding depth.

To better illustrate MTP behavior, we use a longer prompt that encourages extended generation:

```python
from tilert.models.deepseek_v3_2.dsa_show_hands import ShowHandsGenerator

generator: ShowHandsGenerator = ShowHandsGenerator(
    max_new_tokens=1000,
    model_weights_dir=MODEL_WEIGHTS_DIR,
    with_mtp=True,  # Enable MTP
)
generator.from_pretrained()
prompt = "Tell me 10 jokes, keep them all under 100 words."

print("Prompt:", prompt)
print("Completion:")
completion = generator.generate(prompt)
```

When MTP is enabled, TileRT may report statistics similar to the following during generation:

```text
Accepted length: mean=2.77, min=1, max=4
```

This indicates that, on average, multiple tokens are accepted per decoding step under MTP.

<details>
<summary><b>Sample output (click to expand)</b></summary>

```text
Of course! Here are 10 short jokes for you.

1. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.

2. I invented a new word: Plagiarism.

3. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.

4. I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down.

5. What's the best thing about Switzerland? I don't know, but the flag is a big plus.

6. I told my computer I needed a break, and now it won't stop sending me vacation ads.

7. Why did the scarecrow win an award? He was outstanding in his field.

8. What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta.

9. I told my suitcase there's no vacation, and now it has a lot of baggage.

10. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.
```

</details>

This example highlights how MTP enables TileRT to efficiently generate longer outputs by accepting multiple tokens per decoding step, while preserving the same Python API interface.

## Status & Future Work

TileRT is currently offered as a preview release, and we’re just getting started.
We are continuously improving the installation experience and enhancing end-to-end performance. Future releases will keep pushing the boundaries of low-latency generation.

Thank you for your interest and support — stay tuned, even faster token generation is on the way!
